            text="Lakewood Ranch High Schoolâ€™s TSA chapter is highly devoted to each and every event that they compete in, including VEX Robotics. On December 16, 2017 our chapter hosted a VEX Tournament at our high school. For the VEX tournament they invited all schools--middle and high schools--in the area to compete in the tournament. Around 30 teams came to participate, and the event lasted from 8:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening, beginning with inspections and ending with an awards session. At the tournament, Lakewood Ranch High School TSA chapter members had the opportunity to volunteer, and in return received a portion of their state fees paid for using the money collected at the concession stand."
